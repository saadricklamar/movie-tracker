## Movie Tracker

Movie-Tracker is a web based application built in React and Redux that tracks the hottest and latest movies. Users are prompted to create an account upon which they can login. From there they can browse the newest movies, favorite movies they like, and view those favorites. 

## Project Goals:

* Implement Router and Redux
* Implement SRP (single responsbility principle) in application logic.
* Create modular, reusable React components.
* Create a well constructed UI.
* Use propTypes to manipulate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

You must first run the back-end server by entering the following commands into your terminal:

* `git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker backend`
* `cd movie-tracker backend`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* the backend server must run on `http://localhost:3000`

Now you can set up the front-end:

* Create new tab in your terminal and cd into the main movie-tracker directory
* `git clone https://github.com/saadricklamar/movie-tracker.git`
* `cd movie-tracker`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
